# Ipswich Retail E-commerce Application (DevOps Practices)

## Overview

I built a fully functional **e-commerce web application** using the **Django framework** with a **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture. The application includes core features such as **user authentication** (sign-up and sign-in), **CRUD operations** for managing users and products, and an intuitive **admin panel** for backend management. To enhance the development and deployment process, I integrated **DevOps practices** like **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions**, ensuring automated testing and smooth deployments. Additionally, I implemented **containerization** with **Docker** to ensure consistency across development, staging, and production environments. The project demonstrates a modern approach to scalable web development with efficient collaboration and deployment workflows.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products.
- **Order Processing**: Manage customer orders and track shipping.
- **Customer Management**: Maintain customer profiles and purchase history.
- **Analytics**: Generate reports on sales and customer behavior.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Django (Python)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS
- Backend: Django's MVT architecture
- Database: SQLite (or any configured database)
- Version Control: Git
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Containerization: Docker
- Deployment: Render.com
- Monitoring: UptimeRobot
- Collaboration Tools: GitHub Issues, Slack

## Prerequisites
- Python (v3.8 or above): Required for running the Django application.
- Pip: Python package manager to install dependencies.
- Git: For version control and accessing the project repository.
– Docker: (Optional but recommended) To run the application in a containerized environment.
- Virtual Environment: To isolate the Python environment (e.g., venv or virtualenv).
– SQLite (or another database): Pre-installed with Django for local development.
– Postman (or similar API testing tools): For testing API endpoints.
- Render.com Account: For deploying the application (if deployment is needed).
- UptimeRobot (Optional): For monitoring application uptime in production.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcommerceApp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EcommerceApp
   ```

## Usage
